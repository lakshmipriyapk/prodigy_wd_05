How It Works:
HTML:
The weather-container div contains the structure for the weather app, including a search box and placeholders for weather information.
CSS:
The body has a blue gradient background that creates a visually appealing interface.
The weather-container div has a semi-transparent background with rounded corners, and the elements are styled to be clean and readable.
JavaScript:
The script.js file fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
The user can input a location, and when the "Get Weather" button is clicked, the app fetches the weather data for that location and updates the page with the current weather, temperature, and humidity.
Important Notes:
API Key: Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your actual API key from the OpenWeatherMap API. You can sign up for a free API key at OpenWeatherMap.

Units: The API fetches temperature data in Celsius (units=metric). You can change this to Fahrenheit by using units=imperial.

Conclusion:
This weather application is a simple and interactive web page that allows users to fetch and display current weather conditions for a specified location. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can create a user-friendly interface that makes use of external APIs to provide real-time data to users.
